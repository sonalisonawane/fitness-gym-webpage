            <h3>Tip No. 1: Drink plenty of water or other calorie-free beverages.</h3>
            <p>Before you tear into that bag of potato chips, drink a glass of water first. People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger, so you can end up eating extra calories when an ice-cold glass of water is really all you needed. If plain water doesn't
                cut it, try drinking flavored sparkling water or brewing a cup of fruit-infused herbal tea.</p>
            <h3>Tip No. 2: Eat protein at every meal.</h3>
            <p>Protein is the ultimate fill-me-up food -- it's more satisfying than carbs or fats and keeps you feeling full for longer. It also helps preserve muscle mass and encourages fat burning. So be sure to incorporate healthy proteins like seafood,
                lean meat, egg whites, yogurt, cheese, soy, nuts, or beans into your meals and snacks.</p>
            <h3>Tip No. 3: Stock your kitchen with healthy, convenient foods.</h3>
            <p>Having ready-to-eat snacks and meals-in-minutes on hand sets you up for success. You'll be less likely to hit the drive-through or order a pizza if you can throw together a healthy meal in five or 10 minutes. Here are some essentials to keep
                on hand: frozen vegetables, whole-grain pasta, reduced-fat cheese, canned tomatoes, canned beans, pre-cooked grilled chicken breast, whole grain tortillas or pitas, and bags of salad greens.</p>
            <h3>Tip No. 4: Always eat breakfast.</h3>
            <p>It seems like an easy diet win: Skip breakfast and you'll lose weight. Yet many studies show the opposite can be true. Not eating breakfast can make you hungry later, leading to too much nibbling and binge eating at lunch and dinner. To lose
                weight -- and keep it off -- always make time for a healthy morning meal, like high-fiber cereal, low-fat milk, and fruit.</p>
